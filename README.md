# About

This is a GitHub page to host clinical cases being developed in the Laboratory of Applied Informatics Research (LAIR). These cases are designed to teach analytics to healthcare students. Each case is a seperate jupyter notebook file. Notebooks can be run through [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Current cases are available in both R and Python.
