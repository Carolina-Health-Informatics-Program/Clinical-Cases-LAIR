    "Diabetes describes a group of metabolic disorders that is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose (blood sugar). Insulin is a critical hormone that allows the body to take up glucose and use it as energy. Diabetes occurs when your body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin well. When this happens, glucose stays in your blood instead of being used as energy. Over time, this glucose in your blood can lead to various health problems. These can include serious complications such as blindness, limb amputation, and stroke. \n",

    "Diabetes is common among individuals over 45 years old, have a family history of diabetes, and are overweight. Poor lifestyle choices such as not exercising or smoking can also increase the risk. Diabetes is one of the most common conditions in the United States with over 30 million people suffering from diabetes. The total estimated cost of diabetes to the health care system is estimated to be $327 Billion. Current treatment includes insulin and medication to control blood glucose levels. Lifestyle modifications before the onset of diabetes can make a huge difference in whether a person develops diabetes. Any algorithm which could reliably predict diabetes could give providers critical information to intervene before a patient has diabetes."
