This is a common misconception that even experienced analysts need to watch out for. Including too many features in your prediction model can lead to what is known as 'overfitting'. Overfitting is essentially where you build a model that adheres too closely to your current data set and is unable to predict observations that are not from your current data set. In other words, it is where you develop a model that tuned too closely to your current data, and is not generalizable to outside data sources. \n",

    "Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD) is a medical condition consisting of three key features: asthma, chronic/recurrent rhinosinusitis (inflammations of sinuses and nasal cavity), and nasal polyps. The symptoms are a result of an abnormal reaction from the body's immune system, known as a hypersensitivity reaction, to aspirin. The disorder is thought to be caused by an anomaly in the metabolism of a substance known as arachidonic acid. Medications, such as aspirin, block the COX-1 enzyme, a critical enzyme involved in arachidonic acid metabolism. This leads to increased production of proinflammatory cysteinyl leukotrienes, a series of chemicals involved in the body's inflammatory response. This resulting overproduction causes severe exacerbations of asthma and allergy-like symptoms.\n",
