The disease can often cause acute airway constrictions sometimes known as “asthma attacks.” Clinicians refer to this airway restriction as “bronchospasm” and it results in cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and extreme situations such as death from respiratory arrest. Currently, approximately 10 people die from asthma attacks per day in the US.\n",

Overfitting is essentially where you build a model that adheres too closely to your current data set and is unable to predict observations that are not from your current data set.
